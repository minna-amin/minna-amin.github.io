               My name is Minna, and I have a degree in Computer Science from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada. I officially graduated in February of 2021. Since then I have been working on various side projects and polishing my skills, as well as learning new ones. For the past few months I have been learning React, and have built a couple simple web apps just for practice. You can find the code on my github, and snapshots in the projects section.

               In December of 2020, I took up a UI/UX design course on Udacity because I was super interested in the topic. I studied Computer science in university, I took many courses that covered the fundementals as well as alot of theoretical stuff. The curriculum did not cover much in the ways of design, so I decided to dive deeper on my own. I have since done a couple projects as well as redesign the UI of an old project I did in school.
