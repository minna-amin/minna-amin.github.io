<p>An app that allows customers to view the menu and order ahead from their favorite cafe.
    This was a project for the UI course I did on Udacity. I chose to design an app for a cafe because I love coffee, and I have tons of experience visiting and ordering from cafes via their menus. I chose a simple design that is to the point, and I stuck with coffee colours for the theme.

<p>
    First I began by interviewing a few people to find out what it is they look for in a cafe generally. For the most part, I found that people go to cafes to work in a different environment, and they look for a calm ambience with efficient service and fast internet. I made the menu easy to navigate in order to place the order and receive it as fast as possible.

    <p>After the interviews I summarized my findings and began sketching out an initial design. I turned the sketch into a low fidelity mock up, then a High fidelity wireframe. I tested the design with a group f volunteers and everyone successfully completed the task of ordering Coffee!</p>
