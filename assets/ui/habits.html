<p>An app that tracks simple habits. A user inputs the habit they would like to track, and they check it off everyday, it would show up on the calendar as colored dots as a way of displaying frequency. </p>

<p>This is a personal project of mine. Habit trackers are wildly popular, and come in different shapes, sizes and media. This design is my take on it. Tracking has helped me develop good, strong habits and it’s very satisfying to tick something off at the end of the day. Pink is my favourite colour, so I chose a palette of pastel pinks and beiges. The app idea is to simply make a habit that you would like to track (drink more water, read for 30 minutes a day etc. ) and click the “done” button everyday after completing the task. It is then marked on the calendar and you’re able to see the frequency of which you did that task.
