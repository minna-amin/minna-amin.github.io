<p>Stdy is an app i worked on as a group project during university that tracks student’s productivity throughout their classes. The original design was done in shades of pink. There was not much range, and the features are hard to distinguish - the design was not accessible enough.

<p>I redesigned the UI independently. I chose a blue palette, it is comfortable to the eye, as well as distinguishable. I added a bar for the buttons at the bottom for better visibility, as well as centered the add task button to simplify the work flow.
