<p>Stdy is an app i worked on as a group project during university that tracks studentâ€™s productivity throughout their classes. The original design was done in shades of pink. There was not much range, and the features are hard to distinguish - the design was not accessible enough.

<p>I redesigned the UI independently. I chose a blue palette, it is comfortable to the eye, as well as distinguishable. I added a bar for the buttons at the bottom for better visibility, as well as centered the add task button to simplify the work flow.
</p>

<p>
The main differences:
I added boxes around tasks so that they are more distinguishable, the white on white of the previous design is not very interesting as well as hard to see for people with visual impairments. I added a footer with all the buttons for pages. This makes it clearer to the user where to navigate from, as well as having symbols that are more accurate descriptions of their content.

I changed the colour theme to shades of blue and yellow accents. While pink is my favourite colour, I do not think it was executed well in the first design. It's all one shade and overwhelming. The blue shades are much more comfortable on the eyes, in my opinion.
