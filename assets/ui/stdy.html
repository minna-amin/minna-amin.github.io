<p>Stdy is an app i worked on as a group project during university that tracks studentâ€™s productivity via their classes and cou. The original design was done in shades of pink. There was not much range, and the colors features are hard to distinguish - the design was not accessible enough.

<p>I redesigned the UI independently. I chose a blue palette, it is comfortable to the eye, as well as distinguishable. I added a bar for the buttons at the bottom for better visibility, as well as centered the add task button to simplify the work flow.
